•	My home page has functionality to login and signup and ShOp MoRe SaVe MoRe button that will also go to the ongoing deal
•	Once sign up is done you need to login and check
•	Once logged in it will redirect you to ongoing deal page
•	There you have the option to logout
•	Admin user details:
Username: Prachi
Password: password
•	Amin user will get one more dropdown in navigation bar to view ongoing deal and to create new deal
•	On view deal at the end he will get option for show, destroy and edit deal 
•	Also I have added the timestamp for creation time of deal and when new deal will come up
•	I have set after 24 hours new deal can come up and for admin option will come up to create new item.
•	From navigation bar he can create more deals before 24 hours as well
•	I have added all the details of the deal
•	While creation of deal these are the assumptions taken for setting up the image
1.	If title = Lavie Handbag + Sling Bag, then corresponding image of bag is set
2.	If title = Bed + Matress, then corresponding image of bed is set
3.	If title = Lunch box + Water Bottle, then corresponding image of lunch is set
4.	If title = Lenovo Laptop + Bag, the corresponding image of laptop is set
5.	Else basic image of deal is set for all other deals
•	I have added the Buy now option also. If you will click then it will ask for confirmation, once done the quantity will get reduced.
